    "# DSPy Tutorial: Evaluator Optimizer Pattern in DSPy\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is DSPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Python) is a framework for programming with language models (LMs) that allows you to:\n",
    "- Build modular AI programs using composable modules\n",
    "- Automatically optimize prompts and few-shot examples\n",
    "- Evaluate and improve your programs systematically\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll create a joke-telling AI that:\n",
    "1. Generates jokes about any topic\n",
    "2. Learns what makes jokes funny through optimization\n",
    "3. Gets progressively better at telling jokes\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll use the evaluator-optimizer pattern, which is a powerful workflow for ensuring our AI program meets all requirements through iterative refinement. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generation**: An LLM performs the task (generating jokes in our case)\n",
    "2. **Evaluation**: A second LLM evaluates if the result meets our criteria (checking if jokes are funny)\n",
    "3. **Refinement**: If needed, the process repeats with adjustments until all requirements are met\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is particularly useful for:\n",
    "- Ensuring consistent quality in generated content\n",
    "- Incorporating synthetic feedback to improve outputs\n",
    "- Systematically optimizing prompts and examples\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Install DSPy and configure language models\n",
    "2. **Basic Programs**: Create simple AI programs with signatures\n",
    "3. **Chain of Thought**: Add reasoning to improve outputs\n",
    "4. **Modular Programs**: Build reusable components\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: Create metrics to measure performance\n",
    "6. **Optimization**: Automatically improve prompts\n",
    "\n",

    "## Summary: What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explored DSPy's key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Signatures** - Simple Input/Output Declarations\n",
    "```python\n",
    "basic_joke_program = dspy.Predict('topic -> joke')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Chain of Thought** - Automatic Reasoning\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cot_joke_program = dspy.ChainOfThought(joke_signature)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Modules** - Reusable Components\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class JokeModule(dspy.Module):\n",
    "    def forward(self, topic: str) -> str:\n",
    "        # Your logic here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Evaluation** - Systematic Performance Measurement\n",
    "```python\n",
    "evaluate = Evaluate(metric=exact_match, devset=valset)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Optimization** - Automatic Prompt Improvement\n",
    "- **Bootstrap**: Selects effective few-shot examples\n",
    "- **MIPRO**: Optimizes both instructions and examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Manual Prompt Engineering**: DSPy handles prompt formatting automatically\n",
    "2. **Data-Driven Optimization**: Use labeled data to improve performance systematically\n",
    "3. **Modular Design**: Build complex AI systems from simple, reusable components\n",
    "4. **Automatic Improvement**: Optimizers find better prompts than manual tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try different signatures and modules for your use case\n",
    "- Create custom evaluation metrics\n",
    "- Experiment with different optimizers\n",
    "- Build multi-step AI pipelines with multiple modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy building with DSPy! 🚀"
